# Using Gherkin to Format User Stories

## What is Gherkin?

Gherkin is a plain-text language with a simple structure used to define test cases in Behavior Driven Development (BDD). It uses natural language constructs to describe software behavior without getting into implementation details. Gherkin serves as documentation, automated tests, and development guidance all in one.

## Core Gherkin Keywords

### Primary Keywords:
- **Feature**: High-level description of a software feature
- **Scenario**: Concrete example of how the feature should behave
- **Given**: Preconditions or initial context
- **When**: Actions or events that trigger the behavior
- **Then**: Expected outcomes or results
- **And**: Additional conditions, actions, or outcomes
- **But**: Negative assertions or exceptions

### Secondary Keywords:
- **Background**: Steps that are common to all scenarios in a feature
- **Scenario Outline**: Template for multiple similar scenarios
- **Examples**: Data tables for scenario outlines
- **Rule**: Groups related scenarios under a business rule

## Basic Gherkin Structure

```gherkin
Feature: [Feature Name]
  [Feature Description]

  Scenario: [Scenario Name]
    Given [precondition]
    When [action]
    Then [expected result]
```

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Define the Feature
1. Start with the `Feature:` keyword
2. Write a clear, concise feature title
3. Add a brief description explaining the business value
4. Include the user story context

### Step 2: Create Scenarios
1. Use `Scenario:` keyword for each test case
2. Write descriptive scenario names
3. Focus on behavior, not implementation
4. Keep scenarios independent

### Step 3: Structure Steps
1. **Given**: Set up the initial state
2. **When**: Describe the action taken
3. **Then**: Verify the expected outcome
4. Use **And**/**But** for additional steps

## Complete Example

### Traditional User Story:
"As a customer, I want to add items to my shopping cart so that I can purchase multiple products together."

### Gherkin Format:

```gherkin
Feature: Shopping Cart Management
  As a customer
  I want to add items to my shopping cart
  So that I can purchase multiple products together

  Background:
    Given I am a registered customer
    And I am logged into the website

  Scenario: Successfully add item to empty cart
    Given I am viewing a product page for "Wireless Headphones"
    And my shopping cart is empty
    When I click the "Add to Cart" button
    Then the item should be added to my cart
    And the cart icon should show "1" item
    And I should see a confirmation message "Item added to cart"

  Scenario: Add multiple quantities of the same item
    Given I am viewing a product page for "Wireless Headphones"
    And my shopping cart is empty
    When I select quantity "3"
    And I click the "Add to Cart" button
    Then my cart should contain "3" units of "Wireless Headphones"
    And the cart total should reflect the correct price

  Scenario: Add item to cart that already contains items
    Given my cart already contains "1" unit of "Bluetooth Speaker"
    And I am viewing a product page for "Wireless Headphones"
    When I click the "Add to Cart" button
    Then my cart should contain "1" unit of "Bluetooth Speaker"
    And my cart should contain "1" unit of "Wireless Headphones"
    And the cart icon should show "2" items

  Scenario: Attempt to add out-of-stock item
    Given I am viewing a product page for "Limited Edition Headphones"
    And the product is marked as "Out of Stock"
    When I try to click the "Add to Cart" button
    Then the button should be disabled
    And I should see the message "This item is currently out of stock"
```

## Advanced Gherkin Features

### Scenario Outline with Examples

```gherkin
Scenario Outline: Add different product types to cart
  Given I am viewing a product page for "<product>"
  And the product is in stock
  When I click the "Add to Cart" button
  Then the "<product>" should be added to my cart
  And I should see confirmation "<message>"

  Examples:
    | product           | message                    |
    | Wireless Mouse    | Mouse added to cart        |
    | Gaming Keyboard   | Keyboard added to cart     |
    | USB Cable         | Cable added to cart        |
    | Phone Case        | Case added to cart         |
```

### Using Data Tables

```gherkin
Scenario: Add multiple items at once
  Given I am on the product catalog page
  When I add the following items to my cart:
    | Product         | Quantity | Price  |
    | Laptop Stand    | 1        | $29.99 |
    | Wireless Mouse  | 2        | $15.99 |
    | USB Hub         | 1        | $12.99 |
  Then my cart should contain all the items
  And the total should be "$74.96"
```

### Using Rules for Organization

```gherkin
Feature: User Authentication

  Rule: Users must provide valid credentials to access the system

    Scenario: Successful login with valid credentials
      Given I am on the login page
      When I enter valid username and password
      Then I should be redirected to the dashboard

    Scenario: Failed login with invalid credentials
      Given I am on the login page
      When I enter invalid username or password
      Then I should see an error message
      And I should remain on the login page

  Rule: Account lockout after multiple failed attempts

    Scenario: Account locked after 3 failed attempts
      Given I have failed to log in 2 times
      When I fail to log in again
      Then my account should be locked
      And I should see a lockout message
```

## Best Practices

### Writing Clear Scenarios
- ✅ Use active voice and present tense
- ✅ Be specific about expected outcomes
- ✅ Focus on user behavior, not UI elements
- ✅ Keep scenarios independent and isolated
- ✅ Use meaningful, descriptive names

### Language Guidelines
- ✅ Write from the user's perspective
- ✅ Use domain language that stakeholders understand
- ✅ Avoid technical implementation details
- ✅ Be consistent with terminology
- ✅ Keep steps simple and focused

### Scenario Organization
- ✅ Group related scenarios under features
- ✅ Use Background for common setup steps
- ✅ Order scenarios from simple to complex
- ✅ Include both positive and negative scenarios
- ✅ Cover edge cases and error conditions

## Common Patterns

### Login/Authentication Pattern
```gherkin
Given I am not logged in
When I navigate to the login page
And I enter my credentials
Then I should be logged in successfully
```

### Form Validation Pattern
```gherkin
Given I am on the registration form
When I submit the form with invalid data
Then I should see appropriate error messages
And the form should not be submitted
```

### API Response Pattern
```gherkin
Given the API is available
When I send a GET request to "/api/users"
Then I should receive a 200 status code
And the response should contain user data
```

### Navigation Pattern
```gherkin
Given I am on the home page
When I click on the "Products" menu
Then I should be taken to the products page
And I should see a list of available products
```

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing Gherkin scenarios:

- [ ] Does each scenario test one specific behavior?
- [ ] Are the steps written in natural language?
- [ ] Can a business stakeholder understand the scenarios?
- [ ] Are scenarios independent of each other?
- [ ] Do scenarios cover both positive and negative cases?
- [ ] Are the Given/When/Then steps clearly defined?
- [ ] Is the feature description clear and valuable?
- [ ] Are scenario names descriptive and unique?

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Too Technical
```gherkin
Given I set the database state to "initial"
When I call the API endpoint with POST method
Then the HTTP response code should be 201
```

### ✅ User-Focused
```gherkin
Given I am a new customer
When I create an account with valid information
Then my account should be created successfully
```

### ❌ UI-Dependent
```gherkin
Given I click the button with id "submit-btn"
When I enter "test@email.com" in the email field
Then I should see the text "Success" in the div with class "message"
```

### ✅ Behavior-Focused
```gherkin
Given I am on the registration page
When I submit the form with a valid email address
Then I should see a success confirmation
```
