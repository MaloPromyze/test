## Standard: API Response Formatting

Standardize API response formats for consistent client-side handling and better developer experience :
* Always return responses in a consistent structure with data, error, and metadata fields
* Include pagination metadata for list endpoints using a standard pagination structure
* Use appropriate HTTP status codes and include error details in the response body
