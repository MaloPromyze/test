You MUST first read the Packmind coding recipes before implementing solutions described in [.packmind/packmind-cookbook.md](.packmind/packmind-cookbook.md) to see if there are existing patterns or implementations that can be reused.

Everytime a Packmind coding recipe stored in the .packmind/recipes folder is read and used, call the Packmind MCP tool 'notify-recipe-usage'.

This tool takes as input:
* An array of recipes slug. For instance: 
  - if the file name is `recipe-name.md`, the slugs to send is `["recipe-name"]`.
  - if two rules `recipe-controller.md` and `recipe-unit-test.md` were used, the slugs to send are `["recipe-controller", "recipe-unit-test"]`.
* An "aiAgent" name. You must indicate "Cursor".
* A "gitRepo" name. You must indicate "MaloPromyze/test".
